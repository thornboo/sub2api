# Asynchronous Image Tasks

Asynchronous image tasks let clients submit long-running OpenAI-compatible image requests without keeping one HTTP connection open. This avoids proxy/CDN response timeouts such as Cloudflare 524 while preserving the existing image routing, billing, moderation, concurrency, and failover behavior.

## Endpoints

The authenticated gateway exposes both `/v1` paths and their existing no-prefix aliases:

```text
POST /v1/images/generations/async
POST /v1/images/edits/async
GET  /v1/images/tasks/{task_id}
```

The aliases are `/images/generations/async`, `/images/edits/async`, and `/images/tasks/{task_id}`.

Only OpenAI and Grok groups are supported. Requests use the same JSON or multipart payload as the corresponding synchronous endpoint. Streaming image requests are rejected because a polled task returns one final JSON result.

## Enabling the feature (object storage)

Asynchronous image tasks are **disabled by default** and gated on object storage. When the switch is off — or the S3 credentials are incomplete — the async endpoints return `404` and never create a task or write to Redis. This is deliberate: without offloading, large `b64_json` results (several MB each, e.g. `gpt-image-1`) would accumulate in Redis and exhaust its memory.

### From the admin UI (recommended)

**Admin → Backup → Async image object storage.** Saving the form takes effect immediately — the object-storage client is rebuilt on the next request, so there is no container restart.

Because the async image storage and the database backup share one S3 client, the form defaults to **reusing the backup S3 configuration**: it borrows the endpoint, region and credentials already configured above and keeps only its own bucket and prefix, so backups stay under `backups/` while images go to `images/`. Leave the bucket empty to use the backup bucket as well. Untick the box to point images at a completely separate account.

Saving requires step-up 2FA when that gate is enabled, for the same reason the backup S3 form does: changing the target redirects generated content to another account.

Turning the switch off stops new submissions but keeps already-accepted tasks pollable, so nothing in flight is stranded.

### From the config file

The admin setting takes precedence. When nothing has ever been saved there, the `image_storage` block in `config.yaml` is used instead, so deployments that enabled the feature before the admin UI existed keep working untouched.

Configure an S3-compatible object store (AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, Aliyun OSS, MinIO, …) in `config.yaml` (all keys also accept the `IMAGE_STORAGE_*` environment overrides):

```yaml
image_storage:
  enabled: true
  endpoint: "https://<account_id>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com"  # AWS 官方可留空
  region: "auto"
  bucket: "my-images"
  access_key_id: "..."
  secret_access_key: "..."
  prefix: "images/"
  force_path_style: false          # MinIO/path-style buckets set true
  public_base_url: ""              # set to return public_base_url/key直链; empty → presigned URL
  presign_expiry_hours: 24         # presigned link TTL when public_base_url is empty
  max_download_bytes: 33554432     # cap when re-hosting an upstream image URL (32MB)
```

When a task completes, each generated image is uploaded to the bucket and the result is rewritten to a compact form: `data[].url` points at the stored object (a permanent `public_base_url/key` link, or a time-limited presigned URL) and `b64_json` is removed. Only this small JSON is stored in Redis. If an upload fails, the task is marked `failed` rather than persisting the raw base64.

To support a different vendor beyond the S3-compatible client, implement the `service.ImageStorage` interface (`Save(ctx, key, contentType, data) (url, error)`) and provide it in place of the S3 implementation.

### Troubleshooting: the endpoints return 404 after enabling

`404 async image tasks are not enabled` means `image_storage` did not resolve to a complete configuration, so the feature stayed off. The route exists either way — the 404 comes from the handler, not from an unregistered path, which makes it easy to mistake for a missing build.

Check the startup log for:

```text
WARN image_storage.enabled is true but object storage is not fully configured; async image tasks are disabled  missing_keys=[...]
```

`missing_keys` names exactly which credentials were empty when the config was loaded.

Note that releases **before v0.1.161 silently dropped `IMAGE_STORAGE_ENDPOINT`, `_BUCKET`, `_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and `_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`** when they were supplied only through the environment: those keys had no registered default, and viper cannot see an environment variable for a key it does not already know about. Deployments driven purely by `environment:` — which is what `deploy/docker-compose.yml` does by default — therefore reported `enabled: true` with empty credentials and 404'd on every async call. On an affected release the workaround is to also place the `image_storage` block in `/app/data/config.yaml` (copy it from `deploy/config.example.yaml`); once the keys exist in the file, the environment overrides apply normally.

Two further causes of a 404 that are unrelated to storage: the API key's group must be on the **OpenAI or Grok** platform (any other platform, or a key with no group at all, yields `Images API is not supported for this platform`), and a task may only be polled with the **same API key that submitted it** — polling with a different key of the same user returns `image task not found` by design.

## Submit a task

```bash
curl -i https://api.example.com/v1/images/generations/async \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer sk-...' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-image-1",
    "prompt": "A lighthouse during a winter storm",
    "size": "1536x1024"
  }'
```

The server stores the initial task in Redis and responds with `202 Accepted`:

```json
{
  "id": "imgtask_0123456789abcdef",
  "task_id": "imgtask_0123456789abcdef",
  "object": "image.generation.task",
  "status": "processing",
  "phase": "queued",
  "budget": {
    "task_hold_usd": 4.00,
    "status": "held",
    "message": "US$4.00 is temporarily held for this asynchronous task; it is not settled usage."
  },
  "created_at": 1784092800,
  "expires_at": 1784179200,
  "poll_url": "/v1/images/tasks/imgtask_0123456789abcdef"
}
```

`Location` contains the polling path and `Retry-After: 3` provides the recommended polling interval.

For enterprise members with spending limits, `budget.task_hold_usd` is the temporary amount reserved for this task. It is not part of settled usage. `budget.status` progresses through `held`, `settled`, `released`, or `needs_review`; unlimited members can receive `not_required`. This makes a budget rejection caused by active task holds distinguishable from a member whose actual usage is already exhausted.

## Poll a task

Use the same API key that submitted the task:

```bash
curl https://api.example.com/v1/images/tasks/imgtask_0123456789abcdef \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer sk-...'
```

While work is in progress:

```json
{
  "id": "imgtask_0123456789abcdef",
  "task_id": "imgtask_0123456789abcdef",
  "object": "image.generation.task",
  "status": "processing",
  "phase": "running",
  "budget": {
    "task_hold_usd": 4.00,
    "status": "held",
    "message": "US$4.00 is temporarily held for this asynchronous task; it is not settled usage."
  },
  "created_at": 1784092800,
  "expires_at": 1784179200
}
```

On success, `result` mirrors the synchronous image API body, except each image has been offloaded to object storage: `data[].url` points at the stored object and `b64_json` is stripped (so both URL and base64 upstream formats end up as compact stored links):

```json
{
  "id": "imgtask_0123456789abcdef",
  "task_id": "imgtask_0123456789abcdef",
  "object": "image.generation.task",
  "status": "completed",
  "budget": {
    "task_hold_usd": 4.00,
    "status": "settled",
    "message": "The task was billed from actual usage and its temporary hold was closed."
  },
  "http_status": 200,
  "image_url": "https://...",
  "result": {
    "created": 1784092923,
    "data": [{"url": "https://..."}]
  },
  "created_at": 1784092800,
  "completed_at": 1784092923,
  "expires_at": 1784179323
}
```

For URL responses, `image_url` mirrors the first `data[].url` for simple clients. On failure, the task reaches `failed` and exposes the original OpenAI-compatible error object where available:

```json
{
  "id": "imgtask_0123456789abcdef",
  "task_id": "imgtask_0123456789abcdef",
  "object": "image.generation.task",
  "status": "failed",
  "http_status": 502,
  "error": {
    "type": "api_error",
    "message": "Upstream request failed"
  },
  "created_at": 1784092800,
  "completed_at": 1784092923,
  "expires_at": 1784179323
}
```

All submit and poll responses include `Cache-Control: no-store`, preventing a CDN from caching the `processing` state. Tasks and results expire 24 hours after their latest state update. A task executes for at most 30 minutes.

The Redis task snapshot also stores the private budget receipt link and a recovery deadline. PostgreSQL stores the explicit `async_image` receipt kind, task ID, and a `queued` / `executing` durability fence. The handler must persist `executing` before it is allowed to call the upstream. Lifecycle transitions are atomically indexed in Redis as `queued`, `executing`, `finalizing`, and `recovering`.

After a process restart, an overdue task that is still `queued` in both stores is proven not to have reached the upstream and its hold is released. A task that had entered execution or finalization is not replayed; its receipt is marked `ambiguous`, the task returns `budget.status=needs_review`, and the existing reconciliation workflow determines the final charge. Release and ambiguous transitions are fenced by both receipt request ID and image task ID, so a duplicate request cannot mutate the hold belonging to an earlier task. The public budget status comes from the authoritative receipt returned by that transition. Tasks in `needs_review` stay on a low-frequency reconciliation index, so a later receipt settlement or release updates the public budget status instead of leaving stale text until task expiry. If unified billing had already settled the receipt, recovery reports `budget.status=settled` even when the image result itself could not be restored.

If the Redis task key is missing but its PostgreSQL receipt still exists, the poll endpoint returns a customer-safe failed-task tombstone with the current budget status and a recovery explanation. It does not expose the internal receipt or request ID. Unresolved `reserved` / `ambiguous` tombstones remain pollable beyond the normal 24-hour result TTL while they still consume a hold; settled or released tombstones obey the normal task expiry. Every persisted task transition refreshes both the Redis TTL and public `expires_at`. New submissions remain disabled when object storage is unavailable, but polling and budget recovery for already accepted tasks continue. Graceful shutdown waits for the recovery loop to stop using Redis and PostgreSQL before those clients close.

Task ownership is scoped to both user and API key. Unknown task IDs and IDs owned by another key both return `404`, avoiding task-existence disclosure. Polling remains available when the completed generation used the key's remaining balance; normal authentication, disabled-key, user, IP, and group checks still apply.

When a new task cannot fit because other asynchronous tasks are holding part of the same member limit, the API returns `429` with stable error code `ENTERPRISE_MEMBER_ASYNC_BUDGET_UNAVAILABLE`. The protocol-specific error body includes the stable code/reason and a metadata object containing the applicable window, limit, settled usage, active task holds, and requested hold. The human-readable message lists the same values, and they are also available in `X-Sub2API-Budget-*` response headers for clients and support tooling. This error does not mean the listed settled usage has exhausted the budget.
